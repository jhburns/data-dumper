## Running Server

Simply run the command `npm start`

```
info: Endpoints started on port: 3000
info: Connected
info: Valerie Bot - userID (473280648782675978)
info: Run Instance ID: (706557) Up in: 1.254sec
info: Running in: production mode
info: All quotes loaded in: 3.082sec
````

Use `npm run draft` to create new commands while a production instance is already running.
Additionally, adding the args `npm run map -- 'realName->remapName'` lets you treat an existing command
as if 'draft' is true, under a remapping name. These make it easy to run the bot in the same server as production.
